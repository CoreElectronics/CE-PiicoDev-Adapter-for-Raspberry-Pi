# PiicoDev® Adapter for Raspberry Pi

*This is the hardware repo for the [PiicoDev® Adapter for Raspberry Pi](https://core-electronics.com.au/catalog/product/view/sku/CE07690)*

The PiicoDev® Adapter for Raspberry Pi is a great way to connect sensors to your Raspberry Pi. Use the on-board PiicoDev connectors to quickly and easily connect with the [PiicoDev](https://core-electronics.com.au/piicodev) family of sensor modules without soldering.

**Features**

- Rapid prototyping with solderless connections
- Other useful pins are broken out
- PiicoDev connector, compatible with Qwiic and STEMMA QT (3.3V only)
- Manufactured and [supported](https://core-electronics.com.au/contacts/) in Australia by Core Electronics

**Technical Details**

- Dimensions: 22x51mm
- PiicoDev connector pinout:
  -1 GND
  -2 3.3V
  -3 SDA
  -4 SCL
- The I2C Bus presented at the PiicoDev connector contains series 120Ohm resistances to prevent destructive signal undershoot. Refer to the schematic for more information. To operate without these series resistors, users may connect directly to the GPIO instead.
